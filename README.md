## Key Projects
Much of my work is done in a professional setting, creating end-to-end solutions for real-world challenges. These projects represent just a fraction of my work, as I have developed over 13 applications that are currently being used in production by various companies. Due to confidentiality agreements, I am unable to provide detailed information about all of them. However, the following examples provide a glimpse of my capabilities:

1.  **AI-Powered Document Processing:** Developed applications using Generative AI and Natural Language Processing to streamline decision-making processes. This includes automating the creation of summaries for extensive environmental impact studies (often exceeding 1000 pages), and extracting key information from legal documents used to evaluate potential clients for leasing in a major fintech company.

2.  **Web Automation & Process Improvement:** Created a suite of intelligent bots and scripts designed for efficient task automation and overall process improvement. These included conversational bots capable of interacting via voice and text, performing real-world tasks such as responding to emails, handling inquiries, and scheduling appointments, among others.

3.  **Intelligent Video Editing Tools:** Designed and implemented platforms powered by AI to generate optimized video content for a major television channel. These platforms offer dynamic designs, automatic video summaries, and significantly reduce editing time by up to 60%.

4.  **Custom Applications:** Designed and developed tailored tools to meet specific business needs, using a diverse range of technologies, including Python, React, and cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. These solutions are currently deployed and used by several companies, demonstrating their value and effectiveness.

While my GitHub currently doesn‚Äôt showcase many personal projects, I‚Äôm continually exploring ways to share more of my work and ideas here. Stay tuned for updates!
